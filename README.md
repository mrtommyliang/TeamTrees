## Project Description

Team Trees is a movement started by MrBeast (aka Jimmy Donaldson) a popular YouTuber who is known for doing things over the top, Mark Rober, a former NASA engineer, and Destin Sandlin, creator of the channel Smarter Everyday. This movement all started when a subscriber suggest that he plant 20 million trees to celebrate his massive audience growth. Months and several million subscribers later, MrBeast and his team kicked off the [#TeamTrees](https://teamtrees.org/)  challenge while partnering up with the [Arbor Day Foundation](https://www.arborday.org/) who are a reputable organization who agreed to plant one free for every $1 donated.

On top of my own donation, I will be partnering up with a few of my fellow General Assembly graduates to create a beautiful, mobile responsive webpage to celebrate the cause as well as bring attention to the benefits of trees.

## Components

| Component | Description |
| --- | :---: |
| App | This will make the initial data pull and include React Router|
| Header | This will render the header include the nav |
| Footer | This will render the header include the nav |


Time frames are also key in the development cycle. You have limited time to code all phases of the game. Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Also, put a gif at the top of your Readme before you pitch, and you'll get a panda prize.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Adding Form | H | 3hrs| 3.5hrs | 3.5hrs |
| Working with API | H | 3hrs| 2.5hrs | 2.5hrs |
| Total | H | 6hrs| 5hrs | 5hrs |
